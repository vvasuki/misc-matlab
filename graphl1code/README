structSearchInstance.m creates a batch of 100 models (trials) of a given type.
It takes as input the number of nodes and the number of variables, while
the other model aspects, such as graph type, etc. can be set by modifying  
the mtype Hashtable in that function.

logisticRegBoyd.m implements the ell_1 penalized logistic regression.
It is a wrapper for code by Koh, Kim and Boyd. The binaries of their code 
for your platform can be downloaded from http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/l1_logreg/ 

gibbs_mex.cpp needs to be compiled using mex.
See http://cnx.org/content/m12348/latest/ for more info on mex files.

chowliu.m implements the chow liu algorithm to estimate a tree graph.

getGraphModel.m creates a graphical model instance and takes as input a Hashtable
containing the model parameter settings.

getSamples.m gets samples.

starmarg.m implements belief propagation for star graphs.

PS: Something may be wrong with the Gibbs sampling code.
